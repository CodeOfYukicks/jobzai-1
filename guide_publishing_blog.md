# How to Publish a Blog Article on Cubbbe

We have moved to a **Dynamic Content Management System (CMS)**, making it easy to write and publish articles without touching the code.

## 1. Access the Admin Dashboard
Go to: **`/admin/blog`**
*(Note: You must be logged in to view this page)*

## 2. Create a New Article
1.  Click the **"Create New Post"** button in the top right.
2.  You will be taken to the **Editor**.

## 3. Writing Your Article
The editor has two main sections:

### Main Content (Left)
-   **Title**: The headline of your article.
-   **Content**: Write your article here using **Markdown**.
    -   Use `#` for headings
    -   Use `**bold**` for bold text
    -   Use `-` for lists

### Settings (Right)
-   **Status**: Set to **"Draft"** while writing, change to **"Published"** when ready.
-   **Slug**: The URL friendly version of the title (e.g., `my-new-article`). It is auto-generated but you can edit it.
-   **Category**: Choose from the list (Career Advice, Product Updates, etc.).
-   **Excerpt**: A short summary that appears on the card in the main blog page.
-   **Cover Image**: Upload a photo.

## 4. Publishing
1.  Click **"Publish"** (or "Update") in the top right.
2.  Your article is now live at `/blog`.

## 5. Future Automation (Coming Soon)
-   **Auto-Write with AI**: A button to generate the article content for you based on the title.
